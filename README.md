# pipwin-cache
Pipwin calls a now-removed url to build its cache and, because pipwin is required to have the cache in order to function, it is no longer able to install any libraries.
The urls it uses to get the files, however, do still exist and work, so if a existing version of the cache is used instead pipwin will still function.

# Installation
1. Download the `.pipwin` file.
2. Put it in the user directory (`C:\users\<name>\.pipwin`)
3. Run pipwin again.
